You are helping to create technical plan provided in the spec file. Always adhere to any rules or requirements set out in any CLAUDE.md files when responding.

User input: $ARGUMENTS

## High level behavior

Your job will be to turn the spec file into a technical plan:

- A human friendly feature title in kebab-case (e.g. new-heist-form)
- A safe git branch name not already taken (e.g. feature/new-heist-form)
- A detailed markdown plan file under the \_specs/<feature_slug> directory

Then save the plan.md file to disk and print a short summary of what you did.

## Step 1. Extract Feature Slug

extract <feature_slug> from the current branch that is defined in spec file and inform user that you started working for <feature_slug> and will generate a plan.md file in \_spec/<feature_slug>

## Step 2. Parse the arguments

From `$ARGUMENTS`, extract technical implementation details requested

## Step 3. Check for existing plan

Read the plan.md if there is already one created and iterate on that

## Step 4. Ask questions

. ask questions iteratively when you cannot decide with options eash to chose from like A,B or type your advice.

## Step 5. Draft the plan content

Create a markdown plan document that Plan mode can use directly and save it in the \_specs folder using the `feature_slug`.

## Step 6. Create todos

create checkable todo list in \_spec/<feature_slug>/todos.md and check what is done during implementation.

## Step 7. Final output to the user

After the file is saved, respond to the user with a short summary in this exact format:

plan file: \_specs/<feature_slug>/plan.md

Do not repeat the full plan in the chat output unless the user explicitly asks to see it. The main goal is to save the plan file and report where it lives.
